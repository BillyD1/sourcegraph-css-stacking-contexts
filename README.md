# ðŸ’¤ VS Code CSS Stacking Contexts [![Visual Studio Marketplace Version](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/felixfbecker.css-stacking-contexts)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.css-stacking-contexts)

> The problem with z-index is that very few people understand how it really works. Itâ€™s not complicated, but it if youâ€™ve never taken the time to read its specification, there are almost certainly crucial aspects that youâ€™re completely unaware of.
>
> **The key to avoid getting tripped up is being able to spot when new stacking contexts are formed**. If youâ€™re setting a z-index of a billion on an element and itâ€™s not moving forward in the stacking order, take a look up its ancestor tree and see if any of its parents form stacking contexts. If they do, your z-index of a billion isnâ€™t going to do you any good.

This extension makes [Stacking Contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context) **visible** in CSS and SCSS, allowing you to write `z-index` declarations using small values _with confidence_.
